**Libstr** provides functions for working with null-terminated arrays of `char`s.


## Releases

I'll tag the releases according to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). All the macros preceded by `// @public` are considered public: they'll only change between major versions. The other macros could change any time. Non-preprocessor identifiers defined in header files are always considered public. New identifiers prefixed with `str_` or `strm_` (any case) will not warrant a major version bump.

Every version tag will be signed with [my GPG key](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xD020F814) (fingerprint: `0xD020F814`).


## Dependencies

`Package.json` specifies the dependencies of Libstr: where to get them, and what version to use. I've developed a tool called [Puck](https://bitbucket.org/mcinglis/puck) that will parse such a `Package.json`, download the specified repositories, check out the specified version, and, if the dependency has its own `Package.json`, repeat that process for *its* dependencies. With `puck` on your PATH, in the directory of Libstr:

``` sh
$ puck update
$ puck execute build
# Then you are able to:
$ make
```

There's nothing magic to what Puck does, so if you would prefer, you can set up the dependencies manually. You just need to have the dependencies in the `deps` directory within the Libstr directory, and have them built (if necessary) before building Libstr.

### Why AGPL?

[I believe that nonfree software is harmful](http://minglis.id.au/blog/2014/04/09/free-software-free-society.html), and I don't want to contribute to its development at all. I believe that a free society must necessarily operate on free software. I want to encourage the development of free software, and discourage the development of nonfree software.

The [GPL](https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) was designed to ensure that the software stays free software; "to ensure that every user has freedom". The GPL's protections may have sufficed in 1990, but they don't in 2014. The GPL doesn't consider users of a web service to be users of the software implementing that server. Thankfully, the AGPL does.

The AGPL ensures that if Libstr is used to implement a web service, then the entire source code of that web service must be free software. This way, I'm not contributing to nonfree software, whether it's executed locally or provided over a network.
